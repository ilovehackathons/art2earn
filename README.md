# art2earn
Check it out on [Arweave](https://n5lmnbirgsc4wdfl3e6h63cmyatbsoba4rkpatqvorfvvclwae.arweave.net/b1bGhRE0hcsMq9k8f2_xMwCYZOCDkVPBOFXRLWol2AU/) or [GitHub Pages](https://ilovehackathons.github.io/art2earn/).

art2earn was developed at the [NFTBERLIN & Encode Club Hackathon](https://nftberlin.org/hackathon) and is a React dApp based on the [Public Square App](https://github.com/DanMacDonald/public-square-app) (itself a Twitter clone). Instead of text tweets, this app uses videos in the MP4 file format.

Just like the Public Square App, this app queries transactions from [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org) and displays them in a feed. If the user has connected their wallet (either via [ArConnect](https://www.arconnect.io) or the [Arweave web wallet](https://arweave.app/)), they can upload videos to Arweave themselves (it costs to deploy large files to the network, so one needs to acquire some [AR tokens](https://faucet.arweave.net) first). One optional hashtag per video is supported. Videos can be filtered either by the hastag or sender.

The [project idea](https://www.art2earn.de) was a video platform where creators from the Global South upload their breakdance content. Some videos would be hand-picked by curators to be minted as NFTs and enable a passive income for the video author (hence the name art2earn).
